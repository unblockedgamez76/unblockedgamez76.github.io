                <h2>FNAF 3 Unblocked – Face Your Nightmares at Fazbear’s Fright</h2>

<p><strong>FNAF 3 Unblocked</strong> takes you to Fazbear’s Fright, a haunted horror attraction built around the mysteries of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Unlike previous games, there’s only one real animatronic—Springtrap—but phantoms and hallucinations make survival just as terrifying.</p>

<h2>What’s Different in FNAF 3?</h2>
