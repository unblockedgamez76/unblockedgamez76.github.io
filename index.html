              <strong>What is Unblocked Games? <br></strong>
              Unblocked games are online games that can be played without restrictions, even in places where gaming sites are usually blocked, such as schools and workplaces. Many institutions limit access to gaming websites, but unblocked games bypass these restrictions by being hosted on non-restricted domains or using technologies like HTML5, ensuring smooth gameplay without downloads or special permissions.
